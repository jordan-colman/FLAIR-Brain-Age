# FLAIR-Brain-Age
3D T2-FLAIR brain age prediction model 

Seperate models trained on 1,394 healthy control 3D FLAIR MRIs and 3D T1w MRIs. 3D-Inception-ResNet was compared to DenseNet. Details of training and results under review for puplication and further infomration to follow here. Code for model architecture, training and evaluation included here for the 3D-Inseption_ResNet and DenseNet models.

Model was trained on inputed imaged aligned to MNI space 1mm^3. Images resampled to lower resolution in programme.
